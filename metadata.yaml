description: The history of the Western United States is full of self-made men who
  came from meager circumstances and metamorphosed into rich and powerful tycoons.
  The engaging and gritty novel Reed Anthony, Cowman is a fictionalized but exceedingly
  realistic account of one such figure who rose through the ranching ranks to became
  a formidable businessman.
